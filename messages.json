From your request, I understand that you want me to implement the design and functionality shown in the PDF. Let's break this down and create a beautiful and functional app.\n\nFirst, let me describe what I see in the PDF and outline the features we'll implement:\n\n1. A sleek, modern design with a dark theme\n2. A header with a logo and navigation menu\n3. A main content area with a search bar and a grid of movie posters\n4. Movie posters with hover effects showing additional information\n5. A footer with copyright information\n\nFor the color scheme, we'll use:\n- Dark background (near black)\n- White text\n- Accent colors: red for highlights, and a gradient of blue to purple for some elements\n\nLet's implement these features step by step:\n\n\n\n\nimport type { Config } from \"tailwindcss\"\n\nconst config = {\n  darkMode: [\"class\"],\n  content: [\n    './pages/**/*.{ts,tsx}',\n    './components/**/*.{ts,tsx}',\n    './app/**/*.{ts,tsx}',\n    './src/**/*.{ts,tsx}',\n\t],\n  prefix: \"\",\n  theme: {\n    container: {\n      center: true,\n      padding: \"2rem\",\n      screens: {\n        \"2xl\": \"1400px\",\n      },\n    },\n    extend: {\n      colors: {\n        border: \"hsl(var(--border))\",\n        input: \"hsl(var(--input))\",\n        ring: \"hsl(var(--ring))\",\n        background:"
